## Casbin Authorization Middleware for Kratos.

[Casbin](https://casbin.org) is a powerful and efficient open-source access control library for Go. It provides support for enforcing authorization based on various models. So far, the access control models supported by Casbin are:

- ACL (Access Control List)
- ACL with superuser
- ACL without users: especially useful for systems that don’t have authentication or user log-ins.
- ACL without resources: some scenarios may target for a type of resources instead of an individual resource by using permissions like write-article, read-log. It doesn’t control the access to a specific article or log.
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- RBAC with resource roles: both users and resources can have roles (or groups) at the same time.
- RBAC with domains/tenants: users can have different role sets for different domains/tenants.
- ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)
- RESTful
- Deny-override: both allow and deny authorizations are supported, deny overrides the allow.
